# Adaptive Control of Process Variables
I am currently a Fellow at Insight Data Science working on a consulting project with a start-up company. They want to build components based on 3D printing technology.

During the process there is a laser that melts the material while the printer is moving, building the component layer by layer. There are many process variables affecting the quality of the process.

The goal of this project is to understand the relationship between the process variables and build a model that predicts the characteristics of the product.
