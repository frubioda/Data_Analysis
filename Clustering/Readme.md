### Data

Two files of randomized data are attached that are similar to some of the data in our system:
-	delivery_geography
-	order_id: unique identifier per order (int)
-	latitude: delivery location (degrees)
-	longitude: delivery location (degrees)
-	estimateddeliverytime: an estimate of how long a delivery took (seconds)
-	delivery_prices
-	order_id: unique identifier per order (int)
-	deliveredat: time delivered (timestamp)
-	totalprice: total product price (USD)

Applied KNN Clustering algorithm to separate different regions in a map and different user behaviors.
