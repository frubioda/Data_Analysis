# Data Science Coding Challenge:

The file contains a list of businesses which are fairly representative of data from external data providers. 
Each business has the following fields:

- **name**: The name of the business
- **address**: The street address of the business
- **city**: The city the business is in
- **zip**: The businesses zip code
- **time_in_business**: The years the company has been in business
- **phone**: The businesses phone number
- **category_code**: The [NAICS](https://classcodes.com/naics-code-list/) code for the business
- **headcount**: The number of people employed by the business
- **revenue**: The revenue (in thousands) of the business

Use this data to calculate the following:

1. **Fill Rate**: For each field, how many records have a value.
2. **True-Valued Fill Rate**: For each field, how many records have *relevant* data in them. For example, a field which
has string valued entries may have elements that contain something like `' '`. This is a string but may not be
'good' data depending on the field.
3. **Cardinality**: The cardinality of each field.
4. **Something interesting**: Find something cool or odd in the data set and tell us about it.
